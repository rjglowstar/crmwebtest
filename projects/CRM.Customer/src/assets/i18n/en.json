    "EdSubTitle": "Education Change the world",
    "EdDesc": "There was a time when India was known as 'Vishwa Guru,' and its foundation was Paravidya and Aparavidya. But today, the same foundation has entered the field of disability. The reason is the lack of basic facilities for the attainment of knowledge. Shri Keshubhai Haribhai Goti's heart began to sweat when he saw such a situation firsthand in a remote village in Gujarat. He gifted a beautiful and well-equipped complex in the same village. On that day, not only the people of the village but also the experts in the education sector and friends from the industrial sector, seeing this, thanked them profusely. He thought, 'How many villages will there be like this?' He himself made an effort for the survey, and since that day, the process of building convenient education complexes has gone on successfully in 145 villages in more than 15 states of India. With the contribution of cooperative donors and the personal contribution of the presented trust, a flame of revolution has started burning in the education sector.",
